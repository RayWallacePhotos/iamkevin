<h1>			Gone With The Wind</h1>

<div class=Center>When I go broke</div>
<div class=Center>(And I will)</div>
<div class=Center>I will survive.</div>
<div class=Center>I will let the grass grow high in the Spring, Summer and Fall</div>
<div class=Center>like some of my neighbors do already.</div>
<div class=Center>I will sell my car.</div>
<div class=Center>And I will shovel a narrow path to the street in the Winter.</div>
<div class=Center>I will use the public transportation service provided for people such as myself.</div>
<div class=Center>I will get rid of 3 televisions and 4 or maybe even 5 telephones.</div>
<div class=Center>I might keep the cellphone.</div>
<div class=Center>I will probably have to give up my computer</div>
<div class=Center>It is important to me although for my artwork (to keep a record of all artwork and to print out</div>
<div class=Center>artwork, etc.) and writing.</div>
<div class=Center>I will use my benefits for limited use of heat and electricity and water and sewer and R.E. taxes</div>
<div class=Center>for my house</div>
<div class=Center>And food and limited inexpensive art supplies.</div>
<div class=Center>I will seek food coupons and shop carefully and frequent food pantries.</div>
<div class=Center>I will most likely never purchase another article of clothing the rest of my life.</div>
<div class=Center>If necessary there are establishments which provide inexpensive or free clothing.</div>
<div class=Center>It still will be with all these efforts a big battle.</div>
<div class=Center>I am no Scarlett O'Hara</div>
<div class=Center>But I swear when the time comes</div>
<div class=Center>I will climb that hill like she did ---</div>
<div class=Center>Get on my knees</div>
<div class=Center>And</div>
<div class=Center>Dig until my fingers are raw looking for a potato spud</div>
<div class=Center>Screaming "With God as my Witness."</div>
<div class=Center>I will survive as well when I reach those end points.</div>
<div class=Center>God is a good witness in many areas of life.</div>
<div class=Center>Especially when many people from all around have ill will towards you</div>
<div class=Center>And there seems just little to do but hold on.</div>
<div class=Center>And nobody believes.</div>
<div class=Center>Like the monkey in the tree branch up high looking down</div>
<div class=Center>At the zoo visitors every day----</div>
<div class=Center>And they take shots at him with their cameras.</div?
