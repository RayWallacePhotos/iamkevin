<h1>			The Wise Bird</h1>

<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>Yesterday at the Clubhouse my boss asked anyone who wants to go on one of the three computers
in the conference room which we sit in all day and write either an article or a poem.
I said I would like to write a poem. I stood up and asked the fairly severely mentally
challenged member next to me what he would like me to write a poem about. He said
"Nature and Maybe God!"</p>

<p>So I signed my name on the log in sheet for the computer and what I was doing etc. and the time.
This is the poem that I wrote off the top of my head right on the computer in exactly one half
hour.</p>

<h2>			The Wise Bird</h2>

<br> My father passed away two years ago.
<br> It was very difficult for me since I was so close to him.
<br> He was 84.
<br> Soon after my father died I started noticing the same gray bird perched on the uppermost
<br> of the electrical wires in front of my driveway every single day.
<br> He seemed to be watching over what was my father's prized possession - his Classic 1996 Buick
<br> Roadmaster Station wagon.
<br> This graceful bird sits in the exact same spot up high facing my back door over and over very faithfully.
<br> He makes a sound like an owl all day long and at times even at night.
<br> The sound he makes is very unique - not quite exactly like an owl.
<br> It is a slow, mellow cooing.
<br> I can even hear him from inside my house sometimes.
<br> Amazingly, even during the height of the terrible, windy ice storm this winter he remained in his
<br> spot on the wires motionless somehow.
<br> I always take time to look up for him every day.
<br> It seems he is my only friend sometimes.
<br> I was looking at a print of a painting by Degas last week in my therapist's office.
<br> I realized that the word "Degas" spelled backwards spells the word "saged".
<br> "Saged" may not technically be a word.
<br> The word "sage" means a wise person however.
<br> I decided that the word "saged" means "to become wise".
<br> Somehow I think my bird has become "saged".
