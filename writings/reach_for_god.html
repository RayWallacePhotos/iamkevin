<h1>			Reach For God</h1>
<h2>		    by Kevin J. McCarthy</h2>


<p class="Script">
<br>Like your quick approach for the apple in the
<br>Strongly-branched tree in the field behind the house -
<br>Reach for God.
</p>

<p class="Script">
<br>Outstretched gloved right hand while rock climbing -
<br>Like the small crevice inches away from your
<br>Reach for God.
</p>

<p class="Script">
<br>Like the dying elderly man raising his arm very
<br>Slowly one last time towards his son as he leaves -
<br>Reach for God.
</p>
