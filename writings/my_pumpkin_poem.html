<h1>			My Pumpkin</h1>
<h2>		    by Kevin J. McCarthy</h2>


  <p>My pumpkin is the merry metamorphosis
<br>of being hollowed and carved,
<br>And it’s the lonely one among
<br>The orange-tufted spheres,
<br>In pyramids beyond.</p>

  <p>My  pumpkin is the glow of October’s children
<br>developing daydreams,
<br>And it’s their fear of many a vicious visage,
<br>sharp and cold.</p>

  <p>My pumpkin is acorns and brown leaves
<br>spiraling together on hilltops,
<br>And it’s an unstuffed scarecrow
<br>plopped in the gutter.</p>

  <p>My pumpkin is the counting
<br>of Hersheys and Milky Ways,
<br>And it’s the candy bag ripping and emptying,
<br>on a dark street.</p>

  <p>My pumpkin is edible shades of orange,
<br>And it stinks when the candle inside
<br>Is lit,</p>

  <p>My pumpkin is smashed in the ivory black
<br>of the autumnal equinox.</p>

  <p>My pumpkin is not.</p>
