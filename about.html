        <p>Kevin was raised and schooled in Leominster and later lived in Boston for 32 years.
          For 20 of those years he resided in a large building called The Chickering Piano Factory which
          was a multi-cultural, mixed-income community for approximately 200 artists. He exhibited his work in their beautiful gallery several times in addition to several exhibits at The South End Public Library and Boston University. </p>

        <p>Kevin returned to Leominster, renewing his interest in his artwork even further than before.
          He has found the art community in the area to be very welcoming and encouraging. </p>

        <p>He was accepted into three exhibits in 2009 at the Fitchburg Art Museum - "Art in Bloom",
          "Snap and shoot" (a photograph exhibit) and had a large painting of The Stone House accepted
          for the Fitchburg Art Museum Regional exhibit. That was a lifelong dream.</p>

        <p>Kevin has exhibited at the Leominster Art Association Annual Art Exhibit for several years.
          During these exhibits one of Kevin's photographs was awarded the Mayor's Award in 2010,
          another in 2014 was awarded first prize in the intermediate acrylic main.    As a member
          he took part in their art sales at the Public Library.</p>

        <p>Twice Kevin was awarded ribbons for the paining entitled "Stranger on a Bench". At the
          Leominster Art Association he was awarded the Second Prize ribbon in the Amateur category.
          Then just a few weeks later his same painting was awarded an Honorable Mention Ribbon at
          The Princeton Annual Art Exhibit. Only 28 ribbons were awarded at the Princeton Exhibit
          out of over 300 pieces of artwork. His works represent oil painting, watercolor, pastel,
          needlepoint, sculpture and photography. </p>

        <p>He took part in a benefit/auction to raise funds to renovate the Arc Clubhouse for the
          Mentally Disabled. His painted chair which he created sold for over $150. </p>

        <p>Kevin’s talents also include poetry and writing.</p>

        <p>Kevin was a long time member of the Leominster Art Center and Gallery when it existed in
          downtown Leominster.</p>
